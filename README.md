# Pong

The classic game pong. 

It doesn't have any advanced ball bouncing mechanics (knowing if you hit the ball while paddle was moving to adjust the angle for example), but as a game it's not awful. This was another project I was instructed to make while learning introductory GUI and Class interaction with the Turtle Module.
